The project "Web Scraping and Analytics" focused on extracting and analyzing data from Yahoo Finance, a platform offering extensive financial information on various securities. The project aimed to scrape stock, mutual fund, and ETF data for analysis.

**Key components of the project included:**

1. **Introduction to Yahoo Finance:**
   - Yahoo Finance is a popular platform providing vast financial data, including stock prices, historical data, and financial news.

2. **Descriptive Analysis:**
   - Objectives included identifying data distribution, checking for outliers, and measuring central tendencies like mean, standard deviation, and quartiles.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Used Matplotlib to create line plots showing the adjusted closing prices and opening prices of stocks over time.

4. **Regression Analysis:**
   - Sought to determine coefficients for predicting stock prices. Outputs included coefficients representing relationships between variables and R-squared values indicating variance explained by the model.

5. **Text Analysis:**
   - Performed word count and sentiment analysis on Yahoo Finance news articles using the NLTK library. Generated word clouds and analyzed text features to determine sentiment scores.

6. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - Utilized a lexicon-based approach to categorize text sentiments from Yahoo Finance news. Found that objective sentiments were higher and more consistent than positive or negative sentiments.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The project demonstrated a high correlation between stock prices and financial news sentiments. Regression analysis showed a high R-squared value but statistically insignificant p-value, indicating a perfect positive correlation.

**Overall, the project presented a comprehensive framework for analyzing stock prices and financial news sentiments, providing insights for investors based on historical data and news sentiment analysis.**
